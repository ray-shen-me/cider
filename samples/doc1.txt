Dear Colleagues,

I am pleased to announce that our annual retreat will take place on April 15-17, 2024, at the Hilton Garden Inn in Vienna, Virginia. This is a great opportunity for us to celebrate our achievements, reflect on our challenges, and plan for our future.

The retreat will include various activities, such as team-building exercises, workshops, presentations, and social events. We will also have some guest speakers from our partners and clients, who will share their insights and feedback on our work. The full agenda will be sent to you in a separate email.

Here are some of the highlights of the retreat:

- On April 15 (7:00 PM - 9:00 PM), we will have a welcome dinner at the Tower Club Tysons Corner, located at 8000 Towers Crescent Dr Ste. This is a prestigious venue where local power players come to work and connect
- On April 16 (9:00 AM - 5:00 PM), we will have a full day of sessions at the ASCE Bechtel Conference Center, located at 1801 Alexander Bell Dr. This is a state-of-the-art facility that offers comprehensive, personalized meeting services.
- On April 17 (8:30 AM - 2:00 PM), we will have a fun day of outdoor activities at Terrapin Adventures, located at 8600 Foundry St. This is a thrilling adventure park that features zip lines, ropes courses, giant swings, and more.
